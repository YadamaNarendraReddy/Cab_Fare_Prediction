# Cab_Fare_Prediction
A machine learning project for predicting cab fares based on various features like pickup and drop-off locations, distance, time of day, passenger count, and other relevant factors. This repository contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment strategies.

📌 Project Overview
Cab fare pricing is affected by multiple factors such as:

1.  Distance between pickup and drop-off points 🛣️
2.  Time of day and day of the week 🕒
3.  Number of passengers 👥
4.  Traffic conditions 🚦
5.  Surge pricing and additional charges 💲
This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate fare amounts using Supervised Learning algorithms.
